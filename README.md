# Infinity Series 

Per Nørgård discovered his infinity series in 1959, and throughout the years it has had a tremendous influence on his compositions.
## Serialism?
The infinity series is a series of numbers - and thus the use of it in musical composition has to be called a serial technique, but Nørgård never falls into the trap of uncritical, mechanical composition. The infinity series is used to create a melodic line, but not at the same time to control rhythmical and dynamic aspects, such as prescribed by Central European serialism.

Nørgård has said that he did not invent the infinity series, but discovered it. In this way he gained insight into a view of the world which was well ahead of his time. This might seem a pompous statement, but in fact the infinity series exhibits a number of fascinating characteristics which one would not hesitate today to describe as fractal. In 1959 there was no real corpus of scientific knowledge concerning this phenomenon, nor a scientific language to describe it. This did not appear on the scene until the general spread of the Chaos Theory around 1980.
